## Informations ##

It was used some tool/framwork to develop this project as:
* Astah: to make the class diagram;
* LaTeX: to write the repport about the project;
* Maven: to run packages and libraries;
* JUnit: to make tests;
* Sonar: to analyze the code;

If you want to use these tools (free) you can find the maven in https://maven.apache.org
the JUnit in http://junit.org and the Sonar in http://www.sonarqube.org .
Also you can use the free licence for 50 days of Astah in http://astah.net . And if you want to write in LaTeX collaborative you can use the website sharelatex.com or https://www.overleaf.com

As we made everything collaborative we decided to use Git. You can find the project in github by the link: http://migre.me/sCi0s to make comments or questions.
